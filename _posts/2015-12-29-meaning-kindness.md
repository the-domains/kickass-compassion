You know that saying that's always attributed to the Buddha? The one where we're supposed to be kind and loving to ourselves first? Almost no one I know understands this. 

Our Western culture is one big epidemic of self-sacrifice mixed with me, me, me. We're so screwed up! 

And we chase happiness rather than meaning in life. Look no further than those people who aimlessly click on the "Zuckerberg is giving away billions, get your share!" rather than really asking what they really want from those billions. What is the core of what you seek? Do you even know? Do you really think more money will create more joy? 

So having loving kindness for yourself begins with this: How to create meaning for your existence. How will you use the one body, the one mind, the one life you have? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2ec07811-806d-4a78-930d-836042e082e9.jpg)
